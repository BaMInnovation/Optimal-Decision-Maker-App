  This app is about selecting the best choice among the alternatives based on the criterias. In a typical case where a user needs to select the best option, there are multiple alternatives available, which are being the optons that could be selected, and the criterias which define the attributes of these alternatives. In the app, after the user provides necessary parameters, like the criterias and their properties, the alternatives to compare, and the Multi Criteria Decision Making method to be used, the alternatives are assigned a score value and based on those scores, user can select the best option with highest score.

A sampke case would be, want to select a job when there are multiple options available, you can start by defining the criterias being salary, company reputation, distance of workplace from home, job satisfaction etc., then filling the properties of criterias like whether a criteria is cost or beneficial (like salary being a beneficial criteria since the larger its value, the better the result be, and the distance of workplace from home criteria being cost since the larger its value, the worse it would become since it would be harder to go work), the importance point (weight) of the criteria (for example maybe salary criteria would be more imortant to take into account than other criterias so its importance point would be larger) etc., and finally defining the alternatives by entering the inputs of them corresponding to the given criterias, and the the app would assign the scores to each of them, so you select the best job option.
