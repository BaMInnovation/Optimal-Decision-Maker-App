# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
  This app is about selecting the best choice among the alternatives based on the criterias. In a typical case where a user needs to select the best option, there are multiple alternatives available, which are being the optons that could be selected, and the criterias which define the attributes of these alternatives. In the app, after the user provides necessary parameters, like the criterias and their properties, the alternatives to compare, and the Multi Criteria Decision Making method to be used, the alternatives are assigned a score value and based on those scores, user can select the best option with highest score.

A sampke case would be, want to select a job when there are multiple options available, you can start by defining the criterias being salary, company reputation, distance of workplace from home, job satisfaction etc., then filling the properties of criterias like whether a criteria is cost or beneficial (like salary being a beneficial criteria since the larger its value, the better the result be, and the distance of workplace from home criteria being cost since the larger its value, the worse it would become since it would be harder to go work), the importance point (weight) of the criteria (for example maybe salary criteria would be more imortant to take into account than other criterias so its importance point would be larger) etc., and finally defining the alternatives by entering the inputs of them corresponding to the given criterias, and the the app would assign the scores to each of them, so you select the best job option.
